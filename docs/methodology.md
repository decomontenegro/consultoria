## 3. ASSESSMENT DIMENSIONS

Based on BCG's Digital Maturity Model (simplified from 41 to 12 executable dimensions):

### 3.1 Developer Productivity Baseline
**What We Measure:**
- Code commits per developer per week
- Pull request cycle time
- Code review turnaround
- Build/test execution time

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- Elite performers: 10+ commits/week, <2hr PR cycle
- High performers: 5-10 commits/week, <4hr PR cycle
- Medium: 2-5 commits/week, <1day PR cycle
- Low: <2 commits/week, >1day PR cycle

**Source**: DORA Report 2024

### 3.2 AI Tools Adoption Level
**Maturity Stages:**
1. None (0%): No AI tools in use
2. Exploring (1-25%): Pilots, individual experimentation
3. Piloting (26-50%): Team-level adoption
4. Production (51-75%): Organization-wide but not systematic
5. Mature (76-100%): Integrated into workflows + ROI tracking

## 4. ROI CALCULATION METHODOLOGY

### 4.1 Voice Coding Productivity Gain

**Formula:**
```
Annual Savings = (Number of Devs) × (Avg Salary) × (Productivity Gain %) × (Time Coding %)
```

**Parameters:**
- **Productivity Gain**: 25% (conservative), 35% (realistic), 45% (optimistic)
  - Source: McKinsey GenAI Report 2024, page 47
  - Note: McKinsey found "35-45% faster code generation"
  - We use 25% as conservative to account for learning curve

- **Time Coding**: 60% (conservative estimate)
  - Source: Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2024
  - Note: Devs spend ~40% time on meetings, reviews, admin

- **Avg Salary**: Industry & seniority-specific
  - Source: Glassdoor Brazil January 2025
  - Updated quarterly

**Example Calculation:**
```
Company: 50 developers, avg salary R$10,000/month
Annual Payroll = 50 × R$120,000 = R$6,000,000
Coding Time = R$6,000,000 × 0.60 = R$3,600,000
Productivity Gain (25%) = R$3,600,000 × 0.25 = R$900,000
Annual Savings = R$900,000
```

### 4.2 Quality Improvement Impact

**Bug Reduction Value:**
```
Annual Savings = (Current Bugs/year) × (Reduction %) × (Avg Cost per Bug)
```

**Parameters:**
- **Bug Reduction**: 30% (conservative)
  - Source: GitHub Copilot Study 2024
  - AI-assisted code shows 30-40% fewer bugs

- **Cost per Bug**: R$2,400 (8 hours senior dev time @ R$300/hr)
  - Source: Industry standard estimation
  - Conservative: assumes simple bugs only

**Example:**
```
Current State: 1000 bugs/year
Reduction: 300 bugs prevented
Savings: 300 × R$2,400 = R$720,000/year
```

### 4.3 Faster Time-to-Market

**Revenue Impact:**
```
Additional Revenue = (New Features/year due to speed) × (Avg Feature Value)
```

**Conservative Assumption:**
- 2 additional major releases per year
- Value = customer-provided or industry average

**Note**: This is the MOST subjective metric - we provide framework but require customer input for accuracy.

### 4.4 Training Investment

**Cost Calculation:**
```
Training Cost = (Devs) × (Cost per Dev) + (Productivity Loss during Training)
```

**Parameters:**
- **Cost per Dev**: R$500 (CulturaBuilder course)
- **Training Duration**: 40 hours (1 week intensive)
- **Productivity Loss**: 30% during training week

**Example:**
```
50 devs × R$500 = R$25,000 direct cost
Productivity loss: 50 devs × R$2,308/week × 30% = R$34,620
Total Investment: R$59,620
```

### 4.5 Payback Period

**Formula:**
```
Payback Period (months) = Total Investment / (Monthly Savings)
```

**Conservative Estimates:**
- Typical Range: 2-6 months
- Factors: team size, current maturity, industry

---

## 5. INDUSTRY BENCHMARKING

We compare companies against:
1. **Sector Average**: All companies in same industry
2. **Top Performers**: 90th percentile in sector
3. **Elite Performers**: Top 5% globally (cross-industry)

**Data Freshness:**
- Benchmarks updated quarterly
- Salary data updated monthly (Glassdoor API)
- Research reports incorporated within 30 days of publication

---

## 6. CONFIDENCE INTERVALS & ASSUMPTIONS

### Risk Factors Considered
1. **Team Size**: Smaller teams (<10) may see higher variance
2. **Current Maturity**: Low-maturity orgs need longer adoption
3. **Industry Regulation**: Healthcare/Finance slower adoption
4. **Technical Debt**: High debt = slower realization of benefits

### Conservative Adjustments
- We apply 20% haircut to all productivity gains for first 6 months
- Ramp-up assumed: 50% Month 1, 75% Month 2-3, 100% Month 4+
